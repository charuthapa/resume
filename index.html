	<h1>NETWORK DEVICES:</h1>
<h2>REPEATER</h2>
<a><img src="Repeater.png" height="200"/></a>
<p>• The main purpose of repeater is to receive a signal and then retransmits those signal.<br/>
• It is used to extend the transmission so that the signal can cover longer distance.<br/>
• It is a two port device.<br/>
• It operates at physical layer.<br/>
• It do not amplify the signal, when the signal becomes weak, it copy the signal bit by bit and then
regenerates it at its original strength.<br/>
• It allows forwarding means it forwards the signal.<br/>
• It provides no filtering means it doesn’t filter signals.<br/>
• Collosion occurs and traffic is high because it’s a pure hardware device and doesn’t contain any 
software, it just forward the signals.<br/>
• It is not used in modern network.</p>

<h2><a name="Hub"></a>HUB</h2>
<p>• A network device that allows you to connect multiple computer to a single network.<br/>
• It is basically a multi-port repeater.<br/>
• It operates at physical layer.<br/>
• Generally, it is used to connect computers in a LAN.<br/>
• It is used to extend the transmission so that the signal can cover a longer distance.<br/>
• It provides the feature of broadcasting. Suppose, there are four devices i.e. A, B, C and D connected 
with hub, now device A wants to send some data to device C, then the hub forward that data to device 
C as well as all the devices connected with hub. This is because there is no software in hub which can 
provides filtering.<br/>
• Collosion occurs, the maximum number of collosion depends on the ‘n’ number of devices.<br/>
• There are three types of hub i.e. Passive hub, Active hub and Intelligent hub.<br/>
• It is not used in modern network.</p>

<h2><a name="Switch"></a>SWITCH</h2>
<p>• A switch is a multiport bridge device with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency and 
performance.<br/>
• It can perform error checking before forwarding data. This makes it more efficient and improves its 
performance as it forwards the good and efficient packet to the correct port only which doesn’t have 
errors.<br/>
• It operates at layer 2 of the OSI model that is the data link layer.<br/>
• It supports unicast, multicast and broadcast communications.<br/>
• It can easily identify that which device is connected with which port by using MAC address, that’s 
why it sends data packets on selective destination port.<br/>
• It is more intelligent or a better version of hub.</p>

<h2><a name="Bridge"></a>BRIDGE</h2>
<p>• A bridge is a repeater with add on the functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC address 
of the source and the destination.<br/>
• It is a network device that is used for interconnecting two LAN’s working on same protocol.<br/>
• It operates at physical layer as well as data link layer.<br/>
• It provides filtering as it doesn’t forward data to all the devices but sends data to the device which you 
want to sent. It is done because of the data link layer.<br/>
• It reduces the amount of traffic on a LAN by dividing it into two segments.<br/>
• Collosion can be reduced easily.<br/>
• It is more intelligent as it first stores the MAC address of the destination and then broadcast data 
accordingly.<br/>
• There are three types of bridges i.e. Local bridge, Remote bridge and Wireless bridge.</p>
